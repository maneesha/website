<h3>VS Code Topics</h3>
Because I'm always forgetting certain commands in VS Code, I made myself a list of the commands I keep having to look up.<hr>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">VS Code Commands (unorganized)</button>
<div class="coll-content">

    <hr>

    <p><b>Autocomplete html tags</b></p>
    <p>If you are in a <code>html</code> file, typing the tag (without the pointy braces) and then hitting <kbd>Tab</kbd> will autocomplete the opening and closing tags, including the pointy braces.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Wrapping text in html tags</b></p>
    <p>If you want to wrap text in html tags but don't want to type the opening and closing tag for each one, use <b>Emmet Wrap with Abbreviation.</b>  Select the text to be wrapped and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd>   <kbd>P</kbd>. Start typing "Emmet..." and autocomplete will take you to <b>Emmet Wrap with Abbreviation.</b>  Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to choose this and then type in the tag you want to use without pointy braces.  Your text will now be wrapped in whatever tags you enter (regardless of whether it is a valid tag).</p>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Previewing Markdown</b></p>
    <p>To preview raw Markdown as rendered Markdown in a new tab in the same pane as your raw file: Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd>. </p>
    <p>To preview raw and rendered Markdown side by side: Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>K</kbd>, then release and hit <kbd>V</kbd>.</p>

    <hr>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Alerts and Notifications</button>
<div class="coll-content">
  <hr>
  <p>VS Code can give you alerts about errors and other status notices. </p>
  <hr>

  <p><b>Error counts</b></p>
  <p>Next to the file name in the Explorer or on the tab of an open file, you may see a number.  This is the count of errors in your file. This can include style or syntax errors. Additional information is available from the View >> Problems menu (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd>.) </p>

  <hr>

  <p><b>File modification</b></p>
  <p>If you use VS Code with Git, you may see green or blue lines next to your line numbers.  Green means     that these are new lines since your last commit; blue means these are modified lines since your next commit.</p>

  <hr> 

  <p><b>View unsaved changes</b></p>
  <p>When you have unsaved changes in your file, the file name will be displayed with a dot in the editor tab and in the "Open Editors" list.  To see a diff of what's been changed, do one of the following. Either will give you the same diff view.  
  
    <ul>
      <li>Right click on the file in the "Open Editors" view and select "Compare with saved"</li>
      <li>Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>K</kbd>, then release and hit <kbd>D</kbd></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
