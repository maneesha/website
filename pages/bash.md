<h3>Bash Topics</h3>
Because I'm always forgetting certain commands in bash, I made myself a list of the commands I keep having to look up.<hr>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Keyboard navigation</button>
<div class="coll-content">

<hr>


<ul>
<li>ctrl-A Goes to start of line</li>
<li>ctrl-E Goes to end of line</li>
<li>alt-F Goes forward 1 word</li>
<li>alt-B Goes back 1 word</li>
<li>ctrl-U Deletes from cursor to start of line</li>
<li>ctrl-K Deletes from cursor to end of line</li>
<li>alt-D Deletes from cursor to end of word</li>
<li>ctrl-XX Toggle between current cursor position and start of line</li>
</ul>


<p>This gives a summary of git log:</p>
<code>git log --oneline</code>
<hr>

<p>Like <code>git log</code> but also shows the files that were changed in each commit.</p>
<code>git log --name-status</code>
<hr>
