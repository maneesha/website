<h3>Bash Topics</h3>
Because I'm always forgetting certain commands in bash, I made myself a list of the commands I keep having to look up.<hr>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Keyboard navigation</button>
<div class="coll-content">

<hr>

<p>Quick commands to get around the line you're typing in bash.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ctrl-A</code> Goes to start of line</li>
<li><code>ctrl-E</code> Goes to end of line</li>
<li><code>alt (or option) -F</code> Goes forward 1 word</li>
<li><code>alt (or option ) -B</code> Goes back 1 word</li>
<li><code>ctrl-U</code> Deletes from cursor to start of line</li>
<li><code>ctrl-K</code> Deletes from cursor to end of line</li>
<li><code>alt-D</code> Deletes from cursor to end of word</li>
<li><code>ctrl-XX</code> Toggle between current cursor position and start of line</li>
</ul>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Bash History</button>
<div class="coll-content">

<hr>

<p>Access your bash history</p>


<ul>
<li><code>history</code> will give you a line numbered list of all the commands you have entered for some period of time, dependent on your system's settings. If you are working in multiple terminal windows, I don't know how to keep track of what's what.</li>
<li><code>!132</code> To run the same command as line 132 (or whatever line) again</li>
<li><code>history | grep "phrase to search"</code> to find lines in your history with that phrase </li>
<li><code>history 5</code> Display just the last 5 (or however many) lines in your history</li>
</ul>
