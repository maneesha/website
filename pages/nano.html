<h3>nano Topics</h3>

<p>My editor of choice for doing most work is vscode or sublime.  I will occasionally use <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a> to make quick edits to files, especially when they are not part of larger projects.  Since I use it rarely, I don't remember most commands.  I made myself a list of the commands I keep having to look up.</p><hr>
