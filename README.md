# My Website
My website is out there but I usually just use it for things I want to have easy reference to. I also use it as something to practice on when it comes to Jekyll website development.  That said, it is a public website, so browse away! 

## Website theme 

The theme comes from the [What a Theme template](https://github.com/thedevslot/WhatATheme).
